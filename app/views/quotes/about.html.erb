        Jessica Brady is an up-and-coming full-stack web developer. She has worn two past career hats--research scientist and secondary science teacher. However, Jessicaâ€™s love for computers stems back to her childhood when her parents had to pull her off her DOS machine to go to bed. Thus, she has decided to finally take her passion and make it a full-time reality. She would love to work on projects concerning either the biological sciences or educational tools. In her free time, you can find Jessica on one the mountains in Colorado or playing a video game.
